                <p>
                    I borns in VietNam until I'm 18 years old.
                    I have finish my high-school diploma before I move to United States.
                    This is also the first time that I go study aboard and the first time
                    to travel out side VietNam.
                    Before move to USA with visa F-1, I want to study about Technology industries.
                    At first, I didn't know that Tech-industry have so much fields to study.
                    In my 2 years of college, I really struggling with my study and school.
                    I don't know if Tech-industry is the right fit to me.
                    But now, I feel different about it because I have found one field that make me
                    love and want to study more Tech-industry. Web-Development is the right choice 
                    for me to pursuit my career and my goal in life to it.
